**Folder Struct:**

* *"core"* - Contains all the code for the bot. This includes the commands, the bot itself, features, and more.

* *"data"* - Contains all the data for the bot. It should be used to store all the information that the bot needs to function. Ideally, this should be a database. 
* *"bin"* - Contains all the binaries for the bot. (e.g. python, node, etc.) Also known as some scripts.

* *"config"* - Contains all the config files for the bot. This is where the bot gets config information from. (e.g. config.json, etc.)

* *"logs"* - Contains all the logs for the bot. This is where the bot logs information to. (e.g. logs.txt, etc.)

* "lib"* - Contains all the libraries for the bot. This is where the bot gets libraries from. (e.g. discord.py, etc.) We only use one central library, and add the rest in there.
